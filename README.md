## üå± Overview

Have you ever needed to overlay images on top of your screen?

If you have, you might have used other programs currently available. This isn't really a problem, but they generally affect *other* windows, which means you need to BYOC (bring your own canvas). This can lead to a lot of set-up that Peek Canvas aims to solve.

Peek Canvas is designed to streamline your overlaying experience:

1. Open and resize Peek Canvas to cover where you want the overlay.
2. Import images into the canvas (Attaching, Dragging Over, or Pasting) and position them as desired.
3. Activate Overlay Mode with: **Alt + Ctrl/Command + O**.

## üö® Be aware

This program is made possible with Electron, the same technology used as the popular communication platform Discord. The "overlay mode" in this application is functionally the same as pinning a discord video chat window "on top". For this reason, there should be no issues using Peek Canvas in combination with video games. Before using this software verify that there are no issues with anti-cheat for your specific game. I am not responsible if you get banned. Use at your own risk.
